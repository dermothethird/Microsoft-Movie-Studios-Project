# Microsoft Movie Studios Analysis

**Authors**: Dermot O'Brien, Ziyuan Wang

## Overview

We have been tasked with providing the head of "Microsoft Movie Studios" three actionable insights that they can use to decide what kinds of films to make. To make these reccommendations, we must first gather movie data from reputable sources, clean the data properly, and analyze and vizualize our findings simply and effectively.

## Business Problem

Microsoft Movie Studios is a relatively new division that is looking to compete with the best movie makers in the business. To do this, they will first need to have a better understanding of their competitors successes and failures, the trends related to the kinds of movies that are successful, the types of movies that have high production costs and gross profits, etc. In this analysis, we hope to provide a clearer picture of the industry and target an area of focus for Microsoft Movie Studios to take advantage of.



## Data

To analyze the movie industry as a whole, we took data from the following sources:

* Box Office Mojo
* Rotten Tomatoes
* The Movie Database (TMDB)
* The Numbers
* Internet Movie Database (IMDB)

These datasets come from reputable sources in the movie industry and include insightful data points like movie ratings, genres, production budgets, gross profits, etc.

## Methods

We merged some of the datasets and filtered out some "bad" data, for example empty content in genre column or some zero ratings. After we get rid of those, we could start the analysis our data through different aspects.

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:
